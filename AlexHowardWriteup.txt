tasks of the team member and the top challenges and learning moments in the project. 

I am very pleased with my team's dedication and our end result. This project required a great degree of communication, and through the course of this project, each team member checked in with the team and updated the team as needed.

My tasks on this project included:
	- Implementing Score History storage and retrieval with firebase
	- Communicating with members of Teams 10 and 2, sending them information and files, and receiving their files. Telling team 10 how to trigger our app, and learning team 2's triggers
	- Implementing the triggering mechanisms for team 2's app
	- Adding custom fields to our test app to customize intent
	- Implementing the receiving mechanism of our first trigger for the first version of the app
	- Planning the app, planning the triggers, planning activities and other classes in the app, documenting our triggers, researching android and git technology.
	- Managing the team, assigning tasks.

At first, our vision for this app was not clear, but through our work, it materialized. We faced challenges planning this app because started with a weak understanding of the android ecosystem. We were not yet familiar with the components we needed in our app. By doing project 2, and working through this project, we gained a greater understanding of how to uses BroadcastRecievers and Services in our app.

Another challenge was getting used to working on Github. Doing this project increased my understanding of git.

Learning moments happened though team communication. Talking with each other about how we were going to implement our own parts of the app increased our understanding of Android as a whole and helped avoid some potential problems. Talking to members of other teams was also helpful in this regard. For example, in project 2 I had problems using a manifest declared receiver, but talking to my team for this project, I learned that manifest declared receivers are not supposed to work for local broadcasts, and you actually need to set up local receivers differently.
